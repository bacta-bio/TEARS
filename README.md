Research article: Spatial engineering of E. coli with addressable phase-separated RNAs

Introduction of the codes: 
haotian colony analyzer: it is a java code, imageJ script to post correction of CellPose analysis, the trained model is based on cells images, available upon request.
haotian_fusion_java: it's to extract the cell's segmentation including all the information around a cell
Merge_process_plot: focus on the circularity and surface merging process, then display by python
